### Twitter Learning Plan
* Set Up a Twitter Account. Add it to the class list.
* Decorate up your account. Give it a good icon, background, and header. (Keep in mind that rhetorically this conveys meaning)
* Make a good bio.
* Follow Everyone on the class list.
* Find 20 people/accounts to follow who are related to your blog. Follow those people. You should look to follow big names as well as smaller ones. Look at follower counts to figure this out.
* Make those people into a list.
* Find four hashtags or searches that relate to you topic area. Save those searches.
* Try out Tweetdeck and one other non-Twitter Twitter client.
