### Tagging Learning Plan

* Go to Delicious and search for a few topics related to your blog. Find 4-5 sites you did not already know about. Add them to your RSS reader.
* Look at the blogs/sites you are following and the tags they use. Make a list of the ones that relate to your area of interest.
* Go thru all the posts you have written already and add tags for them.
* Think not just about the topic of the post, but also the type of content. For example your post might be about "hats," "fashion," and "nyc fashion festival", but it might also contain a "video". All of these can be tags.
